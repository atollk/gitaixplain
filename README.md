# Gitaixplain

Understand git repositories faster than ever.

## Purpose

Gitaixplain aims to use the power of large language models (LLMs) to help you understand Git repositories.

This can be useful when:

- trying to work with a repository with bad documentation.
- wanting to contribute to a repository for the first time.
- trying to understand the inner workings of a repository to learn from it.

The purpose of Gitaixplain is *not* to beat something like Claude projects in the quality of it's analysis.
However, Gitaixplain has the advantages of:

- being a pure frontend app, meaning you can use it from any device.
- not requiring you to clone the repository to your hard drive and uploading it somewhere again, because everything
  happens in the browser in memory.
- allowing you to use any popular AI provider or a local model on your device.
- RAG system specialized on software development tasks. (actually, this is WIP)
